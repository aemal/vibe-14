# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance UI with Animations and Transitions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Add smooth animations and transitions to improve the user experience.
# Details:
Use Framer Motion (v10.12.16) for advanced animations. Add entrance animations for new cards. Implement transition animations when cards move between columns. Add micro-interactions like button clicks and hover effects using Tailwind's transition classes.

# Test Strategy:
Visually inspect all animations and transitions. Ensure they enhance rather than hinder the user experience. Test on different devices to verify performance.
