# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Card Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reusable Card component that displays a title and description preview.
# Details:
Create a Card component using TypeScript. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, including rounded corners (rounded-lg), drop shadows (shadow-md), and consistent spacing (p-4). Implement hover (hover:shadow-lg) and active (active:shadow-inner) states. Use text truncation for long titles and descriptions. Implement a tooltip for full description on hover using @headlessui/react (v1.7.15).

# Test Strategy:
Test the Card component in isolation with various lengths of titles and descriptions. Verify hover and active states work correctly. Ensure the tooltip functions properly and displays the full description.
