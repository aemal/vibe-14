# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support and set up the basic project structure.
# Details:
Use the latest stable version of Next.js (as of June 2023, it's 13.4.4). Run 'npx create-next-app@latest' with the following options: TypeScript: Yes, ESLint: Yes, Tailwind CSS: Yes (as per PRD preference), src/ directory: Yes, App Router: Yes. After initialization, update tsconfig.json for strict mode and other best practices. Set up a basic folder structure: components/, styles/, types/, utils/.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds without errors. Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and the development server runs correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new project directory and initialize it with a package manager (e.g., npm, yarn, or pnpm). Install base dependencies such as TypeScript.
### Details:
Run commands like `npm init -y` and `npm install typescript --save-dev` to create the project and add TypeScript support.

## 2. Configure TypeScript and ESLint [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure ESLint for TypeScript, including necessary plugins and configuration files.
### Details:
Install ESLint, @typescript-eslint/parser, and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin. Create an ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.json` or `eslint.config.mjs`) and set up recommended rules for TypeScript. Optionally, use `npx eslint --init` to generate the config interactively.[1][2][3]

## 3. Set Up Tailwind CSS [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install and configure Tailwind CSS in the project.
### Details:
Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies. Initialize Tailwind configuration files and update your CSS entry point to include Tailwind's directives.

## 4. Organize the Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a logical folder structure for source code, configuration files, and assets.
### Details:
Set up directories such as `src/` for source code, `public/` for static assets, and ensure configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `tailwind.config.js` are in the project root.
