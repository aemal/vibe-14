# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Drag and Drop Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable drag and drop functionality for moving cards between columns.
# Details:
Implement the Draggable component from @hello-pangea/dnd for each Card. Create a function to handle the onDragEnd event, updating the state of the Kanban board when a card is moved. Implement smooth drag animation using the package's built-in features. Add visual feedback when dragging over columns using Tailwind's group-hover classes.

# Test Strategy:
Test dragging cards between all column combinations. Verify that the board state updates correctly after each drag. Check that animations and visual feedback work as expected.
