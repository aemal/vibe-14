# Title: Finalize Documentation and Prepare for Delivery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation and prepare the project for handover.
# Details:
Update the README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Document any known issues or limitations. Create JSDoc comments for all components and important functions. Generate API documentation using 'typedoc' (v0.24.7). Ensure the code is well-commented and follows consistent styling (use Prettier v2.8.8 for code formatting).

# Test Strategy:
Review all documentation for completeness and clarity. Have a team member follow the setup instructions to verify their accuracy. Run a final lint and type-check to ensure code quality.
