# Title: Implement Basic Kanban Board Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic structure of the Kanban board with five columns: Backlog, In Progress, Cancelled, Blocked, and Completed.
# Details:
Create a KanbanBoard component. Implement five Droppable components for each column. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Apply the specified background colors: Backlog (light blue: bg-blue-100), In Progress (light yellow: bg-yellow-100), Cancelled (light red: bg-red-100), Blocked (light gray: bg-gray-100), Completed (light green: bg-green-100). Ensure responsive design using Tailwind's responsive classes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all five columns are rendered correctly with appropriate colors. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes. Ensure that the structure adheres to the Kanban package's requirements.
