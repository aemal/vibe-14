# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Responsive Design
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the Kanban board is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile viewports.
# Details:
Use Tailwind's responsive classes to adjust layout for different screen sizes. Implement a column view for mobile devices, allowing users to swipe between columns. Use the 'react-swipeable' library (v7.0.0) for smooth mobile swiping. Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable on mobile (min 44x44 px touch targets).

# Test Strategy:
Test the application on various devices and screen sizes. Use Chrome DevTools device emulation for initial testing. Conduct usability tests on actual mobile devices.
