# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the Kanban board is accessible to users with disabilities.
# Details:
Add proper ARIA labels to all interactive elements. Ensure the application is fully navigable by keyboard. Implement focus management for modals and draggable elements. Use the 'react-focus-lock' library (v2.9.4) for managing focus in modals. Test with screen readers and ensure all content is announced correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Use automated accessibility testing tools like 'jest-axe' for unit tests. Conduct manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac). Verify keyboard navigation works for all features.
