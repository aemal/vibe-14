# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Add Card Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a mechanism to add new cards to any column.
# Details:
Implement a floating action button (FAB) using @headlessui/react for the 'Add Card' functionality. Create a modal component for the add card form. Include input fields for title (required) and description (optional). Use react-hook-form (v7.44.3) for form handling and validation. Ensure the new card is added to the correct column in the board state.

# Test Strategy:
Test adding cards to each column. Verify form validation works correctly. Ensure new cards appear immediately in the correct column after addition.
