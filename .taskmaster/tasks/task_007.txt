# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Edit Card Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow users to edit existing cards' titles and descriptions.
# Details:
Add an edit button to each Card component. Reuse the modal and form from the Add Card functionality, pre-populating the fields with the current card data. Implement the edit logic to update the board state when a card is modified.

# Test Strategy:
Test editing cards in each column. Verify that changes are reflected immediately in the UI. Ensure that cancelling an edit does not modify the card.
