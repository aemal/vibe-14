		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as initializing the project, configuring TypeScript and ESLint, setting up Tailwind CSS, and organizing the folder structure.",
			"reasoning": "This task is mostly procedural with well-documented steps and minimal decision points, resulting in low cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. However, it involves several distinct setup actions that benefit from being tracked as separate subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure Kanban NPM Package",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for researching the package, installing it, configuring TypeScript types, and integrating the DragDropContext into the layout.",
			"reasoning": "While the installation is straightforward, integrating and configuring a third-party package with TypeScript and ensuring compatibility introduces moderate complexity and multiple logical steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Kanban Board Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for creating the KanbanBoard component, implementing each column, applying Tailwind CSS styles, ensuring responsiveness, and verifying integration with the Kanban package.",
			"reasoning": "Building a multi-column board with responsive design and third-party integration increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, especially with the need for consistent styling and layout."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Card Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for creating the Card component, implementing styling and states, adding text truncation, and integrating the tooltip for full description.",
			"reasoning": "The Card component is reusable and requires handling UI states and accessibility, but each requirement is relatively isolated, keeping complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Drag and Drop Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for integrating Draggable components, handling onDragEnd logic, updating board state, implementing animations, and adding visual feedback.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves event handling, state management, and UI feedback, increasing both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity due to multiple interacting components and user flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Add Card Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for creating the FAB, building the modal form, implementing form validation, updating board state, and ensuring UI updates.",
			"reasoning": "Adding cards involves UI, form validation, and state updates, each with their own logic paths, resulting in moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Edit Card Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for adding the edit button, reusing the modal form, pre-populating fields, and updating the board state on edit.",
			"reasoning": "Editing cards reuses existing logic but adds complexity with state pre-population and update flows, though much is shared with the add functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Board State Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for setting up Context API, implementing useReducer logic, providing state methods, integrating with components, writing unit tests, and verifying state updates.",
			"reasoning": "Centralized state management introduces higher cyclomatic and cognitive complexity due to the need for predictable updates, shared state, and robust testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance UI with Animations and Transitions",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for integrating Framer Motion, adding entrance animations, implementing transition animations, and enhancing micro-interactions.",
			"reasoning": "While animations can be intricate, the requirements are focused and mostly UI-driven, keeping overall complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for applying Tailwind responsive classes, implementing mobile column view, integrating react-swipeable, ensuring touch target sizing, and testing on devices.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring full responsiveness and mobile usability involves multiple UI adaptations and third-party integration, increasing both implementation and testing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Accessibility Features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for adding ARIA labels, ensuring keyboard navigation, managing focus in modals, integrating react-focus-lock, testing with screen readers, and running automated accessibility tests.",
			"reasoning": "Accessibility requires careful attention to detail, multiple testing strategies, and integration of specialized libraries, resulting in high cognitive and implementation complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize Documentation and Prepare for Delivery",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for updating README, documenting known issues, adding JSDoc comments, generating API docs, and ensuring code formatting and style consistency.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation and delivery preparation involve several distinct activities, each important for maintainability but not deeply complex individually."
