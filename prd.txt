# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Kanban Frontend App with Next.js

## Overview

Develop a frontend-only Kanban board application using Next.js and TypeScript. The application will utilize a prebuilt Kanban npm package that supports drag-and-drop functionality. The user will be able to create, edit, and move cards across five color-coded columns: **Backlog**, **In Progress**, **Cancelled**, **Blocked**, and **Completed**.

---

## Goals

* Build a responsive, modern Kanban board UI using Next.js and TypeScript
* Enable drag-and-drop card movement
* Allow card creation with title and description
* Visually distinguish columns with color-coded headers

---

## Technical Requirements

### Framework & Language

* **Next.js** (latest stable version)
* **TypeScript** for all components and logic

### Kanban Board Functionality

* Use a well-maintained and actively supported **Kanban NPM package** (e.g., `@hello-pangea/dnd` or `dnd-kit`)
* Enable **drag-and-drop** functionality for cards between columns
* Create new cards with:

  * **Title** (text input)
  * **Description** (multiline text input)
* Columns:

  * **Backlog**
  * **In Progress**
  * **Cancelled**
  * **Blocked**
  * **Completed**

### UI & Styling

* Each column should have a **distinct background color** for visual differentiation

  * Backlog: Light Blue
  * In Progress: Light Yellow
  * Cancelled: Light Red
  * Blocked: Light Gray
  * Completed: Light Green
* Use **modern CSS techniques** (Tailwind CSS preferred, but not required)
* Ensure **responsive design** for desktop and mobile viewports
* Apply visually pleasing styling to cards and columns with:

  * Rounded corners
  * Drop shadows
  * Consistent spacing
  * Hover and active states for cards and inputs

---

## Features

### Card Creation

* A floating or inline button to **add a new card** in any column
* Input modal or inline form to enter:

  * Title (required)
  * Description (optional)

### Card Management

* **Drag and drop** cards between any of the five columns
* Each card displays:

  * Title
  * Description preview or tooltip

### UX Enhancements

* Smooth drag animation
* Hover effects on cards and column headers
* Clear visual feedback when dragging over columns
* Transitions and animations where appropriate

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Clean and maintainable TypeScript codebase
* Modular and reusable component structure
* No backend or data persistence is required (frontend-only demo)
* Compatible with all modern browsers

---

## Deliverables

* A fully functional **Next.js TypeScript app** with the described Kanban board
* Well-organized component directory structure
* Instructions in `README.md` for running the development server

---

## Out of Scope

* Authentication or user accounts
* Persistent storage (localStorage, database, etc.)
* Server-side functionality or APIs

---

## Notes

* The goal is a high-quality frontend user experience for demo or prototyping purposes
* Avoid using deprecated libraries such as `react-beautiful-dnd`. Prefer actively maintained options like `@hello-pangea/dnd` or `dnd-kit`
